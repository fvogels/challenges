# Audio Compression TODO

Music can be digitized: when you listen to music on your computer, it is encoded using bits.
We now wonder how many bits are needed for this.
For this we need to know how digitization of sound works.

## Question

Say 160kbps bitrate. How many times smaller is it compared to uncompressed music?
Assume

* Bitrate 44100
* Bit depth 16bit
* Stereo sound

For example, if we need 1000 bits per second for uncompressed music and 200 bits per second for compressed music, the answer would be 5.
