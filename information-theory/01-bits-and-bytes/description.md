# Bits & Bytes

Computers store data using electronic circuits that can distinguish between 2 voltage levels, which are represented as 0 and 1.
This is called a `binary digit` or a `bit`.
Since ones and zeros are all the computer can work with, all data must be encoded as a series of `0`'s and `1`'s or `bits`.
An amount of data can therefore be measured in bits.

In practice, however, bits are often bundled together to form *bytes*.
This raises the question, how many bits do fit in a single byte?
Well, *technically*, it depends on the actual machine.
There used to be machines with 6 bit bytes, or 9 bit bytes, but they've gone extinct and nowadays, all machines use 8 bits per byte.

Storage devices (such as SSDs, BluRays, USB keys, SD cards, ...) use bytes as the smallest amount of data.
For example, if you want to store 3 bits worth of data, you still need to use a full byte and then have the remaining 5 bits set to 0.

## Question

Say I have 12,345 bits worth of data, how many bytes of storage do I need?
