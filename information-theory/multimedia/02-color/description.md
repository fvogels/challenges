# Colors

Representing a color using bits might seem tricky, but luckily, it's actually not that complicated.

Most colors can be represented by a mix of red (R), green (G) and blue (B), as if they were ingredients.
For each of these three color we can choose between 256 shades, giving us the ability to represent 16,777,216 different colors.
If you wish to experiment with this, here is a [website](https://rgbcolorpicker.com/) that allows you to play with different RGB values and see what color corresponds to it.
